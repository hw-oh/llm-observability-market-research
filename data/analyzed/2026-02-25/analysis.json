      "overall_summary": "W&B Weave has rapidly evolved from a lightweight tracing tool into a comprehensive LLM ops platform, leveraging the strong foundation of Weights & Biases. Recent updates in early 2026 have significantly closed feature gaps, introducing audio monitors, dynamic leaderboards, and enterprise-grade trace analytics. With robust multimodal support, tight integration with W&B's training/finetuning ecosystem, and stronger guardrails (PII, Hallucination), it positions itself as a top-tier choice for developers who need end-to-end visibility from experiment to production. While it lacks a standalone proxy gateway and advanced embedding visualizations, its strength lies in its developer-centric SDKs and seamless workflow for evaluation and monitoring.",
