# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview

## 1. AI Comment

- W&B Weave strengthened its enterprise security posture by integrating Microsoft Presidio for Python-based PII redaction and expanding audit log capabilities, while Langfuse updated its OpenAI instrumentation to support GPT-5.2.
- Weave continues to differentiate with a built-in evaluation visualizer and native hallucination detection guardrails, whereas Langfuse relies on external libraries for safety evaluations and advanced RAG quality metrics.
- While Langfuse offers a comprehensive open-source solution, Weave leverages the broader Weights & Biases platform for superior experiment tracking and seamless fine-tuning integration.
