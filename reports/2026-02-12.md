# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview | **Data Collected**: 2026-02-12

## 1. Executive Summary

- LangSmith released Self-Hosted v0.13 and introduced EU data residency support to meet stricter regional compliance demands.
- Langfuse launched an Organization Audit Log Viewer and continues to support full self-hosting for governance-focused teams.
- MLflow added Organization Support to enable multi-workspace management and PII masking within its Tracking Server.
- Braintrust expanded its agent observability with support for sub-agent nesting and deep integration with OpenAI agents.
- Arize Phoenix introduced a library of pre-built evaluators specifically for Tool Selection and Faithfulness metrics.
- W&B Weave continues to differentiate with deep nested function call tracing and dynamic leaderboards for LLM-as-a-judge scoring.
- The market saw a broad shift toward agentic support, with Weave, LangSmith, and Braintrust all explicitly tracking retrieval steps and tool calls.

**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith's release of Self-Hosted v0.13 and Langfuse's new Audit Log Viewer directly challenge Weave's competitive advantage in secure, self-managed enterprise deployments.
> Arize Phoenix's addition of specialized Tool Selection evaluators targets the same agentic workflow analysis use case where Weave currently differentiates with deep trace visualization.
> Braintrust's new support for sub-agent nesting and OpenAI integration challenges Weave's positioning as the primary tool for debugging complex, hierarchical agent architectures.
