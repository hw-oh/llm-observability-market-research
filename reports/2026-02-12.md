# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview | **Data Collected**: 2026-02-12

## 1. Executive Summary

- Langfuse introduced Organization Audit Logs and RBAC roles, explicitly targeting enterprise compliance and governance requirements.
- LangSmith released Self-Hosted v0.13, expanding deployment options for teams requiring on-premise or private cloud infrastructure.
- MLflow released Organization Support for its Tracking Server to facilitate management across multi-workspace environments.
- Braintrust updated its agent observability capabilities to support sub-agent nesting while maintaining its hybrid architecture for customer-cloud data residency.
- Arize Phoenix solidified its OpenTelemetry-native positioning with one-line instrumentors and pre-built evaluators for faithfulness and tool selection.
- W&B Weave continues to differentiate via deep integration with the W&B ecosystem, offering native OpenTelemetry support and interactive trace trees for multi-turn agent reasoning.

**Market Insight by AI**:

> Langfuse's addition of RBAC and Audit Logs neutralizes a key enterprise differentiation point Weave previously held via its inheritance of mature W&B platform governance.
> The release of LangSmith Self-Hosted v0.13 and Braintrust's hybrid model increases competitive pressure on Weave to articulate its specific data residency and deployment advantages.
> Arize Phoenix's specialized pre-built evaluators for tool selection highlight a specific feature gap in Weave's broader, flexible custom scorer framework.
