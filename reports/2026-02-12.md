**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith and Langfuse now offer dedicated workflow graph visualizations for agent reasoning, highlighting a gap in Weave's current agent observability toolkit which lacks specific views for memory and state graphs.
> The release of LangSmith's v0.13 self-hosted version and Langfuse's Audit Log Viewer creates increased pressure on Weave to publicly document PII masking and audit capabilities for enterprise compliance.
> MLflow's new visual Judge Builder and MemAlign optimizer challenge Weave's dominance in evaluation integration by offering low-code alternatives to Weave's code-centric evaluation workflows.
