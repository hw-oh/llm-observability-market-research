# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview | **Data Collected**: 2026-02-12

## 1. Executive Summary

- LangSmith released Self-Hosted v0.13, expanding deployment options for on-premise and VPC environments to support data sovereignty requirements.
- Langfuse introduced an Org Audit Log Viewer, adding necessary security visibility and compliance tracking for enterprise-tier users.
- MLflow launched Organization Support to facilitate multi-workspace management, targeting larger engineering teams within the Databricks ecosystem.
- W&B Weave emphasizes its SOC 2 and HIPAA compliance posture while delivering multimodal tracing and a GUI-based judge wizard for evaluation.
- Arize Phoenix solidifies its position in RAG evaluation with DSPy support and specialized visualizations for retrieval chunks and function calls.
- Braintrust continues to leverage a hybrid deployment model that separates the control plane from data residing in customer VPCs to appeal to security-conscious organizations.

**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith's market-leading visualization for agent execution graphs via LangGraph presents a direct challenge to Weave's reliance on hierarchical tree structures for debugging complex agentic workflows.
> The release of LangSmith Self-Hosted v0.13 and Langfuse's Org Audit Log Viewer increases competitive pressure on Weave to aggressively market its own dedicated cloud and compliance features.
> Arize Phoenix's integration of DSPy for offline evaluation and MLflow's no-code judge wizard threaten to erode Weave's differentiation in evaluation workflows unless Weave leverages its multimodal tracing capabilities further.
