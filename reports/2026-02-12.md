# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview | **Data Collected**: 2026-02-12

## 1. Executive Summary

- LangSmith released Self-Hosted v0.13 and introduced EU data residency support to address strict enterprise compliance and data sovereignty requirements.
- Langfuse launched a new Organization Audit Log Viewer for security governance and added rendering capabilities for reasoning steps within its Agent Graphs.
- MLflow introduced Organization Support to enable multi-workspace management and expanded its auto-instrumentation to capture tool calling responses and retriever queries.
- Braintrust updated its platform terminology from 'agents' to 'workflows' to explicitly support sub-agent nesting and released updates to its Python trace scoring.
- Arize Phoenix added specific Faithfulness and Tool Selection evaluators to its open-source library and implemented configurable OAuth2 email extraction.
- W&B Weave expanded its evaluation suite with Audio Monitors and Dynamic Leaderboards while continuing to support SDK-level PII redaction for secure deployments.

**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith's release of Self-Hosted v0.13 and EU data residency directly challenges Weave's enterprise advantage by offering comparable infrastructure control for regulated industries.
> Langfuse's introduction of Agent Graphs for visual workflow topology highlights a specific UI gap in Weave, which currently captures agent steps but lacks a dedicated DAG visualization.
> Arize Phoenix's addition of specialized Faithfulness and Tool Selection metrics increases competitive pressure on Weave to expand its library of pre-built, agent-specific evaluators.
