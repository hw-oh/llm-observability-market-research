- **Braintrust**: Enhanced its operational visibility this week with new AI-powered Topic Maps for automated log filtering and grouping, complementing its strong code-first enterprise evaluation engine.
- **W&B Weave**: Provides comprehensive multimodal support and deeply integrated experiment rollbacks seamlessly coupled to the Weights & Biases ML registry.
- **MLflow**: Shipped a massive update this week, natively introducing Distributed Tracing, a new Judge Builder UI, MemAlign Optimizer, Multi-Workspace Support, and Agent Performance Dashboards.

### Market Trend

The market is rapidly shifting toward specialized agent flow tracing and scalable no-code evaluation builders, with platforms aggressively adopting automated AI-driven judge optimizations and standardized OpenTelemetry architectures.

## 2. Recent Updates

### [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/changelog)
- **Langfuse CLI** (February 17, 2026) — Fully use Langfuse from the CLI. Built for AI agents and power users.
- **Evaluate Individual Operations: Faster, More Precise LLM-as-a-Judge** (February 13, 2026) — Observation-level evaluations enable precise operation-specific scoring for production monitoring.
- **Run Experiments on Versioned Datasets** (February 11, 2026) — Fetch datasets at specific version timestamps and run experiments on historical dataset versions via UI, API, and SDKs for full reproducibility.

### [Braintrust](https://braintrust.dev/docs/changelog)
- **Topics for automated log insights** (February 2026) — Topics automatically analyze and classify logs to surface patterns and insights without manual review. Create topic maps that combine preprocessors (which transform trace data) and AI prompts (which extract summaries) to analyze your logs. Summaries are clustered into meaningful topics using machine learning, then used to automatically classify new and existing traces. Built-in topic maps include Task (user intents), Sentiment (emotional tone), and Issues (agent problems). Custom topic maps enable domain-specific analysis. Topics is in beta for Pro and Enterprise plans.

### [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/releases)
- **MLflow 3.10.0 Released: Multi-Workspace Support, Multi-Turn Evaluation, and UI Enhancements** (February 23, 2026) — MLflow 3.10.0 introduces multi-workspace support for organizing experiments and models with coarser-level granularity in a single tracking server. New multi-turn evaluation and conversation simulation capabilities enable scoring entire conversations instead of individual responses, allowing detection of incomplete answers and lost context in chatbot workflows. Trace cost tracking automatically extracts model information and calculates LLM spending with UI visualization. Navigation bar redesigned with new sidebar for improved feature discoverability. Gateway usage tracking added to monitor AI Gateway endpoints with detailed analytics. In-UI trace evaluation enables running custom or pre-built LLM judges directly from traces without code. MLflow demo experiment added for one-click exploration of tracing, evaluation, and prompt management.
- **MLflow 3.9.0 Released: AI Assistant, Agent Performance Dashboards, Judge Optimization, and Continuous Monitoring** (January 30, 2026) — MLflow 3.9.0 focuses on AI observability and evaluation with an MLflow Assistant powered by Claude Code that understands local codebases and provides context-rich recommendations for LLMOps best practices. New 'Overview' tab provides pre-built dashboards for agent performance metrics including latency, request counts, quality scores, and tool call summaries. MemAlign judge optimizer algorithm introduced for improving LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation quality. Judge builder UI enables creation of custom evaluators. Continuous monitoring with LLM judges allows automatic evaluation of production traces. Distributed tracing support added for complex multi-step AI workflows.
