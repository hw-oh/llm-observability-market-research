# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-13 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview | **Data Collected**: 2026-02-13

## 1. Executive Summary

- LangSmith released Self-Hosted v0.13 and introduced unified cost tracking that now covers LLMs, tools, and retrieval components.
- Langfuse launched an Organization Audit Log Viewer for compliance monitoring and added reasoning step rendering to improve agent visibility.
- MLflow introduced Organization Support to enable multi-workspace management within its Tracking Server, bringing its governance capabilities closer to specialized LLM tools.
- Braintrust added granular cache controls for evaluations to support reproducible enterprise experiments and regression testing.
- Arize Phoenix released new evaluators specifically for tool selection and faithfulness, alongside a GUI-based wizard for configuring LLM judges.
- W&B Weave launched dynamic leaderboards to facilitate team-based evaluation comparisons while maintaining native support for multimodal input tracing.

> **Market Insight**: Langfuse and MLflow's simultaneous release of audit logs and organization-level management features challenges Weave's enterprise readiness narrative by closing the gap on administrative governance. | Arize Phoenix's introduction of a GUI-based wizard for LLM judges directly competes with Weave's existing no-code evaluation creation workflows, commoditizing ease-of-use in judge configuration. | LangSmith's deep agent sandboxes and Langfuse's reasoning step rendering highlight a specific gap in Weave's agent observability, which currently lacks high-level execution graphs for complex agentic workflows.
