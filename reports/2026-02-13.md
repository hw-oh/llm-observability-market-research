# Weekly LLM Observability Market Research Report
**Date**: 2026-02-13 | **Model**: google/gemini-3-pro-preview | **Data Collected**: 2026-02-13

## 1. Executive Summary

- Langfuse introduced rendering support for 'thinking' traces to visualize reasoning steps, while Arize Phoenix released specific metrics for evaluating tool selection and faithfulness in agentic workflows.
- MLflow launched version 3.10, introducing Organization Support to enable multi-workspace management and access control within large enterprise environments.
- LangSmith released Self-Hosted v0.13 to improve infrastructure stability for on-premise deployments while maintaining its streaming support and agent execution graph visualizations.
- Braintrust added a dedicated 'Review' span type to structure human-in-the-loop quality control workflows alongside its existing 'Loop' AI evaluator assistant.
- W&B Weave confirmed SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliance for its VPC options and distinguished its agent observability capabilities with native Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

> **Market Insight**: The release of specialized agentic metrics by Arize Phoenix and 'thinking' trace support by Langfuse directly challenges Weave's agent observability depth, necessitating continued leverage of Weave's exclusive Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to maintain technical differentiation.
