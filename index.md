**Market Insight by AI**:

> MLflow's visual Judge Builder and Arize Phoenix's Dataset Evaluators threaten Weave's evaluation differentiation by simplifying the configuration of automated metrics.
> LangSmith's LangGraph visualization and Langfuse's reasoning step rendering create direct competition for Weave's agentic workflow tracing and tool call analysis.
> Langfuse's Audit Log Viewer and LangSmith's self-hosted v0.13 emphasize a market shift toward strict enterprise governance that exceeds Weave's current RBAC and deployment specifications.
