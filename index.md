[📋 Latest Report (2026-02-11)](./reports/2026-02-11.md)


- Weave establishes a first-mover advantage in multimodal evaluation with the release of **Audio Monitors** (Feb 1), while **LangSmith** and **Braintrust** remain largely text-focused.
- The launch of **Dynamic Leaderboards** (Jan 29) counters **MLflow's** new 'Judge Builder' by offering superior, auto-updating visualization for model comparison, though MLflow's 'MemAlign' offers deeper automation of judge improvement.
- **Weave's** support for **Custom LoRAs** in the Playground (Jan 16) reinforces its unique position connecting training (W&B) to inference, a capability **Langfuse** and **Braintrust** cannot match due to their lack of training infrastructure.
- While **Weave** improves backend tracing, **LangSmith** (LangGraph Studio) and **Arize Phoenix** (Tool Selection Evaluators) are advancing faster on *visual* debugging and specific metrics for agentic workflows.
- **Braintrust** has aggressively expanded SDK support (Go, Java, C#, Ruby), threatening **Weave's** adoption in non-Python/JS enterprise environments.
- **LangSmith**, **Langfuse**, and **Braintrust** all feature mature 'Annotation Queues' for structured human review; **Weave** lacks a comparable dedicated workflow for large-scale manual labeling.

> Weave leads in multimodal evaluation and training-to-inference integration, but faces increasing pressure from LangSmith on visual agent debugging and Braintrust on enterprise language support.
