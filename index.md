**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith's market-leading visualization for agent execution graphs via LangGraph presents a direct challenge to Weave's reliance on hierarchical tree structures for debugging complex agentic workflows.
> The release of LangSmith Self-Hosted v0.13 and Langfuse's Org Audit Log Viewer increases competitive pressure on Weave to aggressively market its own dedicated cloud and compliance features.
> Arize Phoenix's integration of DSPy for offline evaluation and MLflow's no-code judge wizard threaten to erode Weave's differentiation in evaluation workflows unless Weave leverages its multimodal tracing capabilities further.
