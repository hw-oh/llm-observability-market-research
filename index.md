- Braintrust added granular cache controls for evaluations to support reproducible enterprise experiments and regression testing.

> **Market Insight**: Langfuse and MLflow's simultaneous release of audit logs and organization-level management features challenges Weave's enterprise readiness narrative by closing the gap on administrative governance. | Arize Phoenix's introduction of a GUI-based wizard for LLM judges directly competes with Weave's existing no-code evaluation creation workflows, commoditizing ease-of-use in judge configuration. | LangSmith's deep agent sandboxes and Langfuse's reasoning step rendering highlight a specific gap in Weave's agent observability, which currently lacks high-level execution graphs for complex agentic workflows.
