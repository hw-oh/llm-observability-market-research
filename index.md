**Market Insight by AI**:

> Weave's agent observability faces increased pressure as Langfuse and Arize Phoenix release specialized features for rendering reasoning steps and detecting tool selection errors.
> The gap in enterprise readiness widens as LangSmith and MLflow ship robust self-hosted and multi-workspace features, highlighting Weave's current lack of explicit PII masking details.
> Weave maintains a differentiation edge in multi-modal evaluation with new audio monitors, while competitors like Braintrust focus primarily on text-based scoring and human review workflows.
