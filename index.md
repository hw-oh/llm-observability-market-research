[📋 Latest Report (2026-02-11)](./reports/2026-02-11.md)


- Major Market Shift: Humanloop is sunsetting in September 2025 following its acquisition by Anthropic. This creates an immediate, high-priority opportunity for Weave to capture displaced enterprise customers looking for a stable prompt management and evaluation alternative.
- The 'Proxy vs. Async' Divide: Competitors like Braintrust and Helicone are doubling down on Gateway/Proxy architectures to win on cost control, caching, and rate limiting. In contrast, Weave, LangSmith, and Phoenix prioritize async logging for developer ergonomics, creating a distinct architectural split in the market.
- Evaluation Maturity Curve: Leading competitors (LangSmith, Braintrust) are moving beyond simple 'LLM-as-a-Judge' to sophisticated Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows, introducing dedicated 'Annotation Queues' and 'Pairwise Comparison' UIs to operationalize manual review.
- Rise of SQL-based Observability: Logfire and Braintrust (BTQL) are differentiating with SQL-like query languages for traces, appealing to power users who need flexible, code-driven analytics over rigid dashboards.
- Agent-Specific Tooling: The market is shifting from generic LLM tracing to 'Agent' observability. LangSmith, Langfuse, and Logfire have all released specialized visualizations for tool calling, multi-step reasoning loops, and sub-agent nesting.
- OpenTelemetry Standardization: Arize Phoenix, Langfuse, and Logfire are aggressively pushing OpenTelemetry (OTel) and OpenInference as the standard, challenging proprietary SDKs by promising vendor-neutral instrumentation.
- Language Ecosystem Expansion: Braintrust is outflanking competitors on language support, releasing native SDKs for Java, Go, Ruby, and C#, positioning itself as the go-to choice for polyglot enterprise environments.

> Weave remains the premier choice for full-lifecycle ML teams, but faces increasing pressure from proxy-based gateways on cost control and OTel-native tools on standardization.
