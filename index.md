## Executive Summary

<!-- LATEST_REPORT_START -->

[📋 Latest Report (2026-02-12)](./reports/2026-02-12.md)


- Weave established a first-mover advantage in voice agent observability with the Feb 1 release of Audio Monitors, outpacing text-centric competitors like Langfuse and Arize Phoenix in the race for multimodal evaluation.
- Braintrust is aggressively targeting legacy enterprise stacks by adding Java, Go, and C# SDKs, creating a significant barrier to entry for Weave in non-Python/TS environments.
- Weave's 'Data Flywheel' differentiation is strengthening: the ability to hot-swap Custom LoRAs in the Playground (Jan 16) offers an experimentation loop that MLflow and LangSmith cannot replicate without a native training registry.
- Governance pressure is mounting: MLflow's release of 'Organization Support' (Feb 2026) sets a new baseline for multi-team tenancy that Weave must match to secure large-scale platform deals.
- Weave remains vulnerable in the control plane: the continued lack of a native AI Proxy for caching and rate-limiting allows Braintrust to win architectural decisions where production cost-control is the primary KPI.
- The launch of Dynamic Leaderboards (Jan 29) successfully removes manual friction in evaluation reporting, neutralizing a usability advantage previously held by LangSmith's ranking views.
- Strategic Watch: Engineering must prioritize 'Automated Judge Optimization' features; MLflow's new 'Judge Builder' automates evaluation tuning, threatening to make Weave's manual judge setup appear outdated.

> Weave leads the market in multimodal and training-loop observability, but risks losing high-value enterprise platform contracts to Braintrust's superior proxy architecture and broader SDK support.
