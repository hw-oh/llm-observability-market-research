**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith and Arize Phoenix are aggressively targeting agentic workflows with specific tool selection evaluators and reasoning traces, pressuring Weave to expand its agent visualization beyond basic tool call tracing.
> While Weave offers strong on-prem options, Langfuse's new Audit Log Viewer and LangSmith's v0.13 self-hosted release highlight a gap in Weave's explicit documentation regarding PII masking and compliance logs.
> Braintrust's deep IDE integration and MLflow's visual Judge Builder challenge Weave's developer-first positioning by offering tighter coupling between the coding environment and evaluation logic.
