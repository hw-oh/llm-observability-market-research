**Market Insight by AI**:

> LangSmith's release of Self-Hosted v0.13 and EU data residency directly challenges Weave's enterprise advantage by offering comparable infrastructure control for regulated industries.
> Langfuse's introduction of Agent Graphs for visual workflow topology highlights a specific UI gap in Weave, which currently captures agent steps but lacks a dedicated DAG visualization.
> Arize Phoenix's addition of specialized Faithfulness and Tool Selection metrics increases competitive pressure on Weave to expand its library of pre-built, agent-specific evaluators.
